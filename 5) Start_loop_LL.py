"""
We have discussed Floydâ€™s loop detection algorithm. Below are steps to find the first node of the loop.
1. If a loop is found, initialize a slow pointer to head, let fast pointer be at its position.
2. Move both slow and fast pointers one node at a time.
3. The point at which they meet is the start of the loop.
